# RecommendationSytem
Bachelorâ€™s Thesis titled "Personalized Meal Recommendation System", showcasing the implementation and evaluation of different recommendation techniques (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based, and Hybrid). Includes API deployment using FastAPI and performance benchmarking using Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This repository contains a **hybrid meal recommendation system** that blends:
- **Collaborative Filtering (SVD)** using user-meal interaction data
- **Content-Based Filtering** using TF-IDF on meal category descriptions
- **Hybrid Approaches** (both weighted and non-weighted)

The FastAPI server hosts the hybrid (non-weighted) model for interactive recommendation via Swagger UI.

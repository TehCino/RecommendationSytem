# RecommendationSytem

**Bachelorâ€™s Thesis titled "Personalized Meal Recommendation System"**
showcasing the implementation and evaluation of different recommendation techniques (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based, and Hybrid). Includes API deployment using FastAPI and performance benchmarking using Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

**Includes** full FastAPI deployment code (as used in PyCharm)  
**Excludes** dataset due to privacy concerns

## Project Overview

This recommendation system integrates:
- **Collaborative Filtering (SVD)** â€“ Learns user preferences from historical meal interaction data.
- **Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF + Nearest Neighbors)** â€“ Suggests meals with similar categories or characteristics.
- **Hybrid Recommendation** â€“ Combines both methods (non-weighted and weighted versions).

A real-time API was deployed using **FastAPI** and tested via **Swagger UI** in PyCharm.

User behaviour data (e.g., meal views and purchases) was tracked via **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** and joined with metadata (e.g., meal categories) using **Google BigQuery**.

## Model Evaluation

- Code: `model_evaluation.py`

Evaluated on test data using:
- **Precision@5**
- **Recall@5**
- **F1 Score@5**

Benchmarked Models:
- Collaborative Filtering (SVD)
- Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF)
- Hybrid (non-weighted)
- Hybrid (weighted)

## Swagger UI API Demonstration

### ðŸ”¹ Recommend by Category ID

<p align="center">
  <img src="Meals_Reco_by_CategoryId.jpg" width="600"/>
  <br/>
  <em>Input: Meal Category ID in Swagger UI</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Meals_Reco_by_CategoryId_Result.jpg" width="600"/>
  <br/>
  <em>Output: Top meals recommended based on category popularity</em>
</p>

---

### ðŸ”¹ Recommend by User ID (Hybrid)

<p align="center">
  <img src="Meals_Reco_by_id.jpg" width="600"/>
  <br/>
  <em>Input: User ID in Swagger UI</em>
</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="Meals_Reco_by_id_Results.jpg" width="600"/>
  <br/>
  <em>Output: Hybrid recommendations based on user behavior</em>
</p>

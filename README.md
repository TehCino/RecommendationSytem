# RecommendationSytem

**Bachelorâ€™s Thesis titled "Personalized Meal Recommendation System"**
showcasing the implementation and evaluation of different recommendation techniques (Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based, and Hybrid). Includes API deployment using FastAPI and performance benchmarking using Precision, Recall, and F1 Score.

**Includes** full FastAPI deployment code (as used in PyCharm)  
**Excludes** dataset due to privacy concerns

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This recommendation system integrates:
- **Collaborative Filtering (SVD)** â€“ Learns user preferences from historical meal interaction data.
- **Content-Based Filtering (TF-IDF + Nearest Neighbors)** â€“ Suggests meals with similar categories or characteristics.
- **Hybrid Recommendation** â€“ Combines both methods (non-weighted and weighted versions).

A real-time API was deployed using **FastAPI** and tested via **Swagger UI** in PyCharm.

User behaviour data (e.g., meal views and purchases) was tracked via **Google Analytics 4 (GA4)** and joined with metadata (e.g., meal categories) using **Google BigQuery**.
